In contrast to previous studies, our approach allows us to assess the statistical significance of departures from randomness. In addition, we treat space as continuous instead of using an arbitrary collection of geographical units. This avoids problems relating to scale and borders. We apply these tests to an exhaustive U.K. data-set. For four-digit industries, we find that (i) 52% of them are localized at a 5% confidence level, (ii) localization mostly takes place at small scales below 50 km, (iii) the degree of localization is very skewed, and (iv) industries follow broad sectoral patterns with respect to localization. Depending on the industry, smaller establishments can be the main drivers of both localization and dispersion. Three-digit sectors show similar patterns of localization at small scales as well as a tendency to localize at medium scales.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces a measure of the proximity in ideas using unsupervised machine learning. Knowledge transfers are considered a key driving force of innovation and regional economic growth. I explore knowledge relationships by deriving vector space representations of a patent's abstract text using Document Vectors (Doc2Vec), and using cosine similarity to measure their proximity in ideas space. I illustrate the potential uses of this method with an application to geographic localization in knowledge spillovers. For patents in the same technology field, their normalized text similarity is 0.02-0.05 S.D.s higher if they are located within the same city, compared to patents from other cities. This effect is much smaller than when knowledge transfers are measured using normalized patent citations: local patents receive about 0.23-0.30 S.D.s more local citations than compared to non-local control patents. These findings suggest that the effect of geography on knowledge transfers may be much smaller than the previous literature using citations suggests.},

   abstract = {Transformer-based text embedding models have improved their performance on benchmarks like MIRACL and BEIR by increasing their parameter counts. However, this scaling approach introduces significant deployment challenges, including increased inference latency and memory usage. These challenges are particularly severe in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications, where large models' increased memory requirements constrain dataset ingestion capacity, and their higher latency directly impacts query-time performance. While causal language models have addressed similar efficiency challenges using Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, this approach hasn't been successfully adapted to the general text embedding setting. In this paper, we introduce Nomic Embed v2, the first general purpose MoE text embedding model. Our model outperforms models in the same parameter class on both monolingual and multilingual benchmarks while also maintaining competitive performance with models twice its size. We open-source all code, models, and evaluation data to ensure full reproducibility of our training pipeline at \href{https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors}{https://github.com/nomic-ai/contrastors}.},

   abstract = {BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) and RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (similar to 65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering.
In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT.
We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.(1)},

Using survey-based measures of the dimensions of knowledge flows, we identify sources of systematic measurement error associated with backward citations to both patent and nonpatent references. We find that patent citations reflect the codified knowledge flows from public research, but they appear to miss knowledge flows that are more private and contract-based in nature, as well as those used in firm basic research. We also find that firms' patenting and citing strategies affect patent citations, making citations less indicative of knowledge flows. In addition, an illustrative analysis examining the magnitude and direction of measurement error bias suggests that measuring knowledge flows with patent citations can lead to substantial underestimation of the effect of public research on firms' innovative performance. Throughout our analyses we find that nonpatent references (e.g., journals, conferences, etc.), not the more commonly used patent references, are a better measure of knowledge originating from public research.},

   abstract = {This paper makes two contributions to the field of text-based patent similarity. First, it compares the performance of different kinds of patent-specific pretrained embedding models, namely static word embeddings (such as word2vec and doc2vec models) and contextual word embeddings (such as transformers based models), on the task of patent similarity calculation. Second, it compares specifically the performance of Sentence Transformers (SBERT) architectures with different training phases on the patent similarity task. To assess the models' performance, we use information about patent interferences, a phenomenon in which two or more patent claims belonging to different patent applications are proven to be overlapping by patent examiners. Therefore, we use these interferences cases as a proxy for maximum similarity between two patents, treating them as ground-truth to evaluate the performance of the different embedding models. Our results point out that, first, Patent SBERT-adapt-ub, the domain adaptation of the pretrained Sentence Transformer architecture proposed in this research, outperforms the current state-of-the-art in patent similarity. Second, they show that, in some cases, large static models performances are still comparable to contextual ones when trained on extensive data; thus, we believe that the superiority in the performance of contextual embeddings may not be related to the actual architecture but rather to the way the training phase is performed.},

   abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},

   abstract = {Coined by geographers during the 1970s, the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP) is one of the most stubborn problems in spatial analysis when spatially aggregated data are used. Data tabulated for different spatial scale levels or according to different zonal systems for the same region will not provide consistent analysis results. Since spatially aggregated data are often used not just in geographical research, but also in other social science and physical science disciplines, the MAUP has broad impacts. The MAUP effects are functions of the underlying spatial distribution of the data, and their spatial relationships to the spatial scale hierarchy and zonal systems. Several general approaches have been suggested to handle the MAUP. They include simply acknowledging its presence and possibly conducting multiscale and multizonal systems analyses to show the range of possible results. The other extreme is to develop scale-independent or insensitive analytical techniques, but it has little success. One potential direction is to develop a general framework to address the underlying processes of the MAUP. Based upon this framework, specific solutions may be developed.},
