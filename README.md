Dissertation for the MSc in Economics at the LSE

## Overview

IDEA:
1. Download public patent data (possibly for a specific sector, most likely US only)
2. Match names in patents to different ethnicities, I believe there are useful datasets for this freely available
3. Extract some characteristic of these patents from abstract (e.g., skills)
4. Match demographic characteristic from ethnicity to these patents

For 3 a 4, two ideas:
* Health inventions and prevalence of disease it cures
* Skills used by patent (e.g., in software?) and prevalence of skills in other data (e.g., IPUMS)

IDEA:
* Fixed effects if inventors with multiple patents
